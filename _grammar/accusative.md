[/vocab]

The accusative only appears in bound form. The accusative generally denotes the object of the verb, what is being targeted. Since verbs specify their own arguments, there may be exceptions where the accusative fills in another role, or perhaps where another case fills in the role of the accusative.

> Example
>
> The sentence =[oànirào oàn **rooàn**]= means "The warrior fights **warriors**", with `warriors` (in accusative plural) being the target.

As with the nominative, if you wish to list multiple nouns in the accusative, you will need to use conjunctions. There are also verbs that can have multiple bound accusatives. For instance, you can "name _someone_ _something_". Both of these arguments are written in accusative.
