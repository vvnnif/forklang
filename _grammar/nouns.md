# Noun basics
The most important type of word in Lhamisài are nouns. Nouns will not only be used as nouns, but will also be the root of verbs, adjectives, and sometimes even adverbs.

Nouns are found in three grammatical classes: **body**, **spirit**, and **soul**. The only influences of this grammatical class is difference in conjugation. In a lot of cases, which class a word is, is quite predictable. Body nouns are often words for _things_, stuff that is real and hard. Body words also often are very basic abstractions. Spirit nouns are often naturalistic words. Human body parts also count as this. Soul nouns are the most abstract, and also commonly have to do with religion. Or, they can be words easily attributed to or explained by religion.

> Example  
> Consider the following table of words with their class.
> 
> **Body**  | Meaning | **Spirit**  | Meaning | **Soul**   | Meaning
> ----------|---------|-------------|---------|------------|---------
> =[dai]=   | flesh   | =[bho]=     | rain    | =[gòàndàn]= | all
> =[dòei]=  | stone   | =[eieshiò]= | milk    | =[zhaa]=   | god
> =[oàn]=   | warrior | =[medei]=   | forest  | =[dhaa]=   | rose
> =[jàlha]= | speed   | =[dhào]=    | eye     | =[sabhei]= | sky
>
> Note for instance how =[dhaa]= `rose` counts as a Soul class word, as roses are not just flowers, but a very significant symbol. If not for this connection, it would have been a Spirit class word.

Nouns are the most versatile type of word. They can be the subject of the sentence, the target, they can describe the environment, and so much more. This depends on their case. Saia has seven cases:
* The **nominative**, which denotes the subject;
* The **accusative**, which denotes the object;
* The **dative**, which denotes an indirect object;
* The **genitive**, which denotes possession;
* The **locative**, which denotes time and place;
* The **instrumental**, which denotes a tool;
* And the **causative**, which denotes a reason.

See the chapter on nouns for more information. In particular, the section on [Noun Cases](/grammar/noun-cases) and what follows.

Apart from this, nouns can also carry information on time, politeness, and whether the noun represents 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person. For more information on this, see the section on [Temporal Nouns](/grammar/temporal-nouns).

Nouns in Lhamisài do not have articles like `A` or `The` in English. The word =[dhaa]= could either mean "the rose", or "a rose". Whether the speaker is speaking about a specific object or generally, can either be deduced from the context, or doesn't matter.
