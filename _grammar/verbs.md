Verbs in Saia work a little different to what you're used to in English. All verbs are in fact nothing more than nouns with a verb interpretation. Interpreting a verb as a noun can usually be achieved by reading the verb as "_to do (noun)_", "_to use (noun)_", "_to (noun)_", "_to do (noun) things_", etc. Nevertheless, there are still quite a few nouns with a less literal verb interpretation.

Verbs in Saia make no difference between continuous/progressive actions, and discrete actions. "I hit him" and "I was hitting him" turn into the exact same sentence.

> Example
>
> The noun "_research_" turns into a verb "_to do research_".  
> The noun "_milk_" turns into a verb "_to use milk_", more sensibly written as "_to drink milk_".  
> The noun "_rain_" turns into a verb "_to rain_".  
> The noun "_warrior_" turns into a verb "_to do warrior things_", more sensibly written as "_to fight_".  
>
> A less literal example is the noun "_rose_" turning into "_to grow_". This makes sense, as roses are known for their growing.

In any sentence, the first noun of the sentence is the verb. This is their defining feature. As such, word order at the start of the sentence is quite important.

> Example
>
> The verb interpretations of =[oàn]= and =[dhàiòei]= are "to fight" and "to trade", respectively. If you use the empty conjugation for both the noun and the verb, it becomes especially clear how important word order is. You get completely different sentences by just flipping the words around:  
> One way around, =[**oàn** dhàiòei]= means "I, a trader, **am fighting**".  
> The other way around, =[**dhàiòei** oàn]= means "I, a warrior, **am trading**".

# Conjugation
Since verbs are nouns, they are conjugated the same as [temporal nouns](/grammar/temporal-nouns). For convenience, the table is also included here. As opposed to cases being a prefix, temporal conjugation is a suffix.

&nbsp; | **Past** _(Casual)_ | **Past** _(Polite)_ | **Present** _(Casual)_ | **Present** _(Polite)_ | **Future** _(Casual)_ | **Future** _(Polite)_
--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|------------
**1st incl.** | =[-ò-]=    | =[-òbòm-]= |            | =[-ishài-]= | `n/a`     | `n/a`
**1st excl.** | =[-òshà-]=| `n/a`       | =[-ishà-]=| `n/a`      | `n/a`     | `n/a`
**2nd**       | =[-òa-]=   | =[-òmam-]= | =[-emòa-]=  | =[-emòm-]= | =[-a-]=   | `n/a`
**3rd**       | =[-òrà-]= | =[-òràm-]=  | =[-irào-]=  | =[-iràm-]= | =[-iarà-]= | =[-iaràm-]=

The attentive reader will notice that these conjugations are exactly the same as the conjugation of [the copula](/grammar/copula). This is not an accident of course. You can interpret this either as the copula turning nouns into verbs by being directly affixed, or the copula being an empty verb and conjugated as such.

# Verb arguments
Verbs often have arguments. For instance, in English, you do not simply "give". Usually, you "give _someone_ _something_". Sometimes these arguments are optional. You can "eat", but you can also "eat _something_". The order these arguments are put in is not that important as the cases differentiate them from each other. Sometimes, however, multiple arguments use the same case. In that case, the order matters.

What the conjugation and meaning of the arguments are can be found in the built-in dictionary. The arguments of verbs are called _bound_ nouns, while everything else is _unbound_. The [verb voice](/grammar/verb-voice) also influences the arguments. For instance, the active voice introduces a bound nominative, as you need someone to do things.

> Example
>
> Using =[noedhe]= as verb "to hate", you require a nominative for the person who hates, and an optional accusative for the target of this hate. Then =[noedhirào òan reòan]=, meaning "The warrior hates the warrior", has nominative =[oàn]= and accusative =[reoàn]=. See the chapter on [noun cases](/grammar/noun-cases) for more information on these conjugations.
