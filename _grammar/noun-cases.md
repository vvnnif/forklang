# Noun cases
## Noun binding
Before we can talk about the seven cases, we need to discuss bound and unbound nouns, which were passingly mentioned previously. Nouns are bound when they are the argument of the verb of the sentence. For instance, the English verb "to give" can have multiple arguments specific to that verb: what are you giving? To whom? Unbound nouns are all nouns that are not directly an argument of a verb. They can describe the location, circumstance, and more; they are completely optional.

In all the discussion of cases that follows this entire chapter, we will assume a sentence written in the active voice. For more information on voices, see the much later section on [verb voice](/grammar/verb-voice). The information here is "generic" and surface level. More specific constructions using certain cases get their own chapter later.

## The seven cases
There are seven cases in Lhamisài, which are conjugated based on the three noun classes Body/Spirit/Soul, in both singular and plural. Unlike most languages with cases, the cases here are a _prefix_ instead of a suffix.

[todo]
These cases are pretty work-in-progress and will probably be redone a bunch. Note in particular that some canon cases like =[-az-]= are not included. Once redone properly, update all the examples.
[/todo]

&nbsp; | **Body** _(Sing)_ | **Body** _(Plu)_ | **Spirit** _(Sing)_ | **Spirit** _(Plu)_ | **Soul** _(Sing)_ | **Soul** _(Plu)_
---------|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------
**Nom**  |              | =[-i-]=     |             | =[-ò-]=    |             | =[-a-]=
**Acc**  | =[-re-]=     | =[-ro-]=    | =[-lei-]=   | =[-lò-]=   | =[-lha-]=   | =[-lhai-]=
**Dat**  | =[-me-]=     | =[-mo-]=    | =[-nhei-]=  | =[-nhò-]=  | =[-ngaò-]=  | =[-ngao-]=
**Gen**  | =[-o-]=      | =[-io-]=    | =[-ei-]=    | =[-eiò-]=  | =[-ià-]=    | =[-ia-]=
**Loc**  | =[-be-]=     | =[-bhòi-]=  | =[-gòe-]=   | =[-gòi-]=  | =[-dha-]=   | =[-dhai-]=
**Inst** | =[-fe-]=     | =[-fo-]=    | =[-sei-]=   | =[-sò-]=   | =[-shaòa-]= | =[-shaia-]=
**Caus** | =[-bòi-]=    | =[-zòi-]=   | =[-jhei-]=  | =[-jhò-]=  | =[-zhàoa-]= | =[-zhàia-]=

> Example  
> The conjugations of the word =[eie]= `spirit` (a Spirit class word) in plural would be =[òeie]= (nom.) / =[lòeie]= (acc.) / =[nhòeie]= (dat.) / =[eiòeie]= (gen.) / =[gòieie]= (loc.) / =[sòeie]= (inst.) / =[jhòeie]= (caus.).  
> 
> Note all the vowel collapse happening. For instance, we do not spell it =[ò-eie]=, but =[òeie]=.

The next seven lessons will consider these cases in detail. All sentences will be written in the [active voice](/grammar/verb-voice), the most familiar voice to English speakers.
