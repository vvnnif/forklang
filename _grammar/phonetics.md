# Script
Lhamisài is usually written from top to bottom, left to right. For better in-lining in English text however, we will write the text left to right, top to bottom, each line rotated 90°. The characters (that we will soon introduce) are simple geometric shapes, connected together. They are a bit reminiscent of medieval and Renaissant alchemical writing. Words are always surrounded by <conlang-saia></conlang-saia> and <conlang-saia></conlang-saia>, and separated by spaces.

> Example  
> We will write for instance =[aa roàn aaroàn]= horizontally instead of what it properly should be, <vertical-text>=[aa roàn aaroàn]=</vertical-text>

The language has 31 vowel characters, including diphthongs, and 20 consonants. Note that in the bottom left of every page is a button that toggles showing the reading of the script. It can of course be used at all times. The easiest way to learn the script is to just use that button and really focus on the resulting text. Or you could just brute-force learn it. Whatever works.

## Vowels
The basic, non-diphthong vowels are as follows. As you can see, the short vowel variant simply has a line going through the long vowel variant.

=[-i-]= | i | =[-o-]= | o | =[-a-]= | a | =[-ei-]= | ei
--------|---|---------|---|---------|---|----------|---
        |   | =[-ò-]= | ò | =[-à-]= | à | =[-e-]=  | e

There are eight diphthongs involving the =[-i-]= character. The variants where the "i" sound comes first simply overlays the two characters. The variants where the "i" sound comes second makes the character asymmetric. Note that there are no diphthongs combining =[-i-]= and =[-ei-]=.

=[-io-]= | io | =[-ia-]= | ia | =[-iò-]= | iò | =[-ià-]= | ià
---------|----|----------|----|----------|----|----------|----
=[-oi-]= | oi | =[-ai-]= | ai | =[-òi-]= | òi | =[-ài-]= | ài

The other diphthongs combine =[-a-]= or =[-ei-]= with =[-o-]=, including all the swapped asymmetric variants and all the short variants. This gives the following sixteen characters. Note that a short =[-o-]= is written as a =[-io-]= instead of =[-ò-]=, as the usual line is already used for =[-à-]= and =[-e-]=.

=[-ao-]= | ao | =[-eio-]= | eio | =[-ào-]= | ào | =[-eo-]= | eo
---------|----|-----------|-----|----------|----|----------|----
=[-oa-]= | oa | =[-oei-]= | oei | =[-oà-]= | oà | =[-oe-]= | oe
=[-aò-]= | aò | =[-eiò-]= | eiò | =[-àò-]= | àò | =[-eò-]= | eò
=[-òa-]= | òa | =[-òei-]= | òei | =[-òà-]= | òà | =[-òe-]= | òe

## Vowel collapse
Sometimes, grammar would introduce two single vowels next to each other. In this case, if possible, they are turned into one shorter character. For instance, you could be left with =[-i-o-]= next to each other. There exists a shorter diphthong, so the two characters turn into the single =[-io-]=.

## Consonants
The consonants are simply as follows.

=[-m-]=  | m  | =[-n-]=  | n  | =[-q-]=  | q  |          |
---------|----|----------|----|----------|----|----------|---
         |    | =[-nh-]= | nh | =[-qh-]= | qh |          |
=[-s-]=  | s  | =[-sh-]= | sh | =[-jh-]= | jh | =[-f-]=  | f
=[-z-]=  | z  | =[-zh-]= | zh | =[-j-]=  | j  |          |
=[-l-]=  | l  | ?        | ?  | =[-d-]=  | d  | =[-dh-]= | dh
=[-lh-]= | lh | =[-r-]=  | r? | =[-b-]=  | b  | =[-bh-]= | bh

## Consonant collapse
In most cases, consecutive consonants are not allowed. The exception to this are the compounds =[-mb-]=, =[-nhq-]=, and =[-nd-]=. In other cases, if the grammar would force multiple consonants to appear next to each other, they would collapse as follows:
