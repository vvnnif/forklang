The causative will most of the time be unbound. It denotes a "because" clause. While it may simply be a regular noun in the causative, it will most often be a nominalized sentence in the causative form; see the section on sentence nominalization.

> Example
> 
> =[zhaa]= has a verb interpretation of `to pray`. As such, =[zhaa **gòedheola**]= means "I am praying **because of sadness**". Here, `sadness` is written in the Causative, as the sadness is the cause for prayer. Whether this sadness is the speaker's, general sadness in the population, or something else depends on the context.

If there are multiple reasons, multiple causatives can be put one after another in order of decreasing importance.

> Example
> 
> =[zhaa **jheiòedheola** **ioedhàiqa**]= means "I am praying **because of sadness and the economy**", with the economy being the lesser reason.
